# Translations

Each translation of the documentation is maintained in a separate 
repository:

* [English Documentation](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-english)
* [Spanish Documentation](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-spanish)
* [French Documentation](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-french)
* [Brazilian Portuguese Documentation](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-brazilian-portuguese)
* [Japanese Documentation](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-japanese)
* [Simplified Chinese Documentation](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-chinese)
* [Russian Documentation](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit-documentation-russian)

## Adding a new translation

If you want to create a new translation, please open an issue in the issue
tracker of the English documentation, stating which language you would like to
translate. A repository will be created and added to the available translations.

Ideally, you would already have prepared a first version based on a fork or
a copy of the English documentation, which will then be imported into the 
official repository.
