## Contributor Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a 
[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this 
project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Workflow

* Fork the project.
* Make your changes.
* Run `make html` to make sure that the documentation can be built and looks as 
expected
* Send a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

Please make sure that you have 
[set up your user name and email address](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) 
for use with Git. Strings such as `silly nick name <root@localhost>` look really 
stupid in the commit history of a project.

Pull requests for changes relating to a specific PHPUnit version of the 
documentation must be based on that version's branch whereas changes for new
versions of PHPUnit must be based on the `master` branch.  

Due to time constraints, we are not always able to respond as quickly as we 
would like. Please do not take delays personal and feel free to remind us if 
you feel that we forgot to respond.
