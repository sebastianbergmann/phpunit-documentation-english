project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Workflow

* Fork the project
* Make your changes
* Run `make html` to make sure that the documentation can be built and looks as expected
* Send a pull request against the oldest branch of the documentation to which your changes are relevant

Please target the oldest branch affected in case your pull request fixes a bug or typo.

Please make sure that you have 
[set up your user name and email address](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) 
for use with Git. Strings such as `silly nick name <root@localhost>` look really 
stupid in the commit history of a project.

would like. Please do not take delays personal and feel free to remind us if 
you feel that we forgot to respond.
