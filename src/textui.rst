****************************
The Command-Line Test Runner
****************************

The PHPUnit command-line test runner can be invoked through the
:file:`phpunit` command. The following code shows how to run
tests with the PHPUnit command-line test runner:

.. parsed-literal::

    ./tools/phpunit tests/ArrayTest.php
    PHPUnit |version|.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

    Runtime:       PHP 8.2.2

    ..                                                                  2 / 2 (100%)

    Time: 00:00.077, Memory: 10.00 MB

    OK (2 tests, 2 assertions)

When invoked as shown above, the PHPUnit command-line test runner will look for a
:file:`ArrayTest.php` source code file in the current working directory, load it,
and expect to find an ``ArrayTest`` test case class. It will then run the tests
found in that class.

Outcome and Issues
==================

PHPUnit separates the *outcome* (errored, failed, incomplete, skipped, or passed) of a test
from the *issues* (considered risky, triggered a warning, ...) of a test.

With regard to outcome, PHPUnit distinguishes between *failures* and *errors*. A test fails
when an assertion failed. This is different from an unexpected exception or a PHP error that
occur while a test is running. When this happens, the test errors.

Errors tend to be easier to fix than failures. If you have a big list of problems, it is
best to tackle the errors first and see if you have any failures left when they are all
fixed.

For each test run, the PHPUnit command-line tool prints one character to
indicate progress:

``.``

    Printed when a successful test has no issues

``F``

    Printed when an assertion fails while running the test method

``E``

    Printed when an error occurs while running the test method

``W``

    Printed when the test triggered a warning

``R``

    Printed when the test has been considered risky (see :ref:`risky-tests`)

``D``

    Printed when the test triggered a deprecation

``N``

    Printed when the test triggered a notice

``I``

    Printed when the test is marked as incomplete (see :ref:`writing-tests-for-phpunit.incomplete-tests`)

``S``

    Printed when the test was skipped (see :ref:`writing-tests-for-phpunit.skipping-tests`)

Command-Line Options
====================

Configuration
-------------

``--bootstrap <file>``

    Configures a PHP script that is included before the tests run. For common use cases, this script
    should not do more than register an autoloader so that PHP can find the tested units of code.

``-c|--configuration <file>``

    Configure PHPUnit's test runner using an XML configuration file. This is not required when the
    configuration file that is to be used is located in the current working directory and is named
    :file:`phpunit.xml`, :file:`phpunit.dist.xml`, or :file:`phpunit.xml.dist`.

``--no-configuration``

    Do not use an XML configuration named :file:`phpunit.xml`, :file:`phpunit.dist.xml`, or
    :file:`phpunit.xml.dist` that is located in the current working directory.

``--no-extensions``

    Do not load PHPUnit test runner extensions from PHP archives (PHARs) from a directory that is
    configured in the XML configuration file. Do not bootstrap PHPUnit test runner extensions that
    are configured in the XML configuration file.

``--include-path <path(s)>``

    Prepend PHP's ``include_path`` with given path(s).

``-d <key[=value]>``

    Set a PHP configuration setting (php.ini).

``--cache-directory <dir>``

    Configure a directory where the PHPUnit test runner can cache data such as test results
    (required for reordering tests based on previous failures, for instance) or information
    about tested code as well as test code generated using static analysis (significantly
    improves performance of code coverage analysis, for instance).

``--generate-configuration``

    Generate an XML configuration file with best practice defaults.

``--migrate-configuration``

    Migrate an XML configuration file from a previous version's format to the current format.

.. _textui.command-line-options.selection:

Selection

    Run all tests except for those from the specified list of comma-separated test suites
    that are defined in the XML configuration file.

``--list-groups``

    List available test groups. Tests can be put into multiple test groups using the attributes
    ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Group``, ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Small``,
    ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Medium``, ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Large``, and
    ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\Ticket``.

    ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\CoversClass`` to document this.

``--uses <name>``

    Only run tests that intend to use ``<name>`` and use code coverage metadata such as
    ``PHPUnit\Framework\Attributes\UsesClass`` to document this.

    filters into a single filter using a *logical and*.
