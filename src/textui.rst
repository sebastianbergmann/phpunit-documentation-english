****************************
The Command-Line Test Runner
****************************

The PHPUnit command-line test runner can be invoked through the
:file:`phpunit` command. The following code shows how to run
tests with the PHPUnit command-line test runner:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ phpunit ArrayTest.php
    PHPUnit |version|.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

    ..

    Time: 0 seconds

    OK (2 tests, 2 assertions)

When invoked as shown above, the PHPUnit command-line test runner will look
for a :file:`ArrayTest.php` sourcecode file in the current working
directory, load it, and expect to find an ``ArrayTest`` test
case class. It will then execute the tests found in that class.

For each test run, the PHPUnit command-line tool prints one character to
indicate progress:

``.``

    Printed when a successful test has no issues

``F``

    Printed when an assertion fails while running the test method

``E``

    Printed when an error occurs while running the test method

``W``

    Printed when the test triggered a warning

``R``

    Printed when the test has been considered risky (see :ref:`risky-tests`)

``D``

    Printed when the test triggered a deprecation

``N``

    Printed when the test triggered a notice

``I``

    Printed when the test is marked as incomplete (see :ref:`writing-tests-for-phpunit.incomplete-tests`)

``S``

    Printed when the test was skipped (see :ref:`writing-tests-for-phpunit.skipping-tests`)

PHPUnit distinguishes between *failures* and
*errors*. A failure is a violated PHPUnit
assertion such as a failing ``assertSame()`` call.
An error is an unexpected exception or a PHP error. Sometimes
this distinction proves useful since errors tend to be easier to fix
than failures. If you have a big list of problems, it is best to
tackle the errors first and see if you have any failures left when
they are all fixed.

``phpunit UnitTest.php``

    Runs the tests that are provided by the class
    ``UnitTest``. This class is expected to be declared
    in the specified sourcecode file.

``--coverage-clover``

    Generates a logfile in Clover XML format with the code coverage information
    for the tests run. See :ref:`code-coverage-analysis` for more details.

``--coverage-crap4j``

    Generates a code coverage report in Crap4j XML format. See
    :ref:`code-coverage-analysis` for more details.

``--coverage-html``

    Generates a code coverage report in HTML format. See
    :ref:`code-coverage-analysis` for more details.

``--coverage-php``

    Generates a PHP sourcecode file that creates an object with the
    code coverage information.

``--coverage-text``

    Generates a logfile or command-line output in human readable format
    with the code coverage information for the tests run.

``--log-junit``

    Generates a logfile in JUnit XML format for the tests run.

``--testdox-html`` and ``--testdox-text``

    Generates documentation in HTML or plain text format for the
    tests that are run (see :ref:`textui.testdox`).

``--filter``

    Only runs tests whose name matches the given regular expression
    pattern. If the pattern is not enclosed in delimiters, PHPUnit
    will enclose the pattern in ``/`` delimiters.

    The test names to match will be in one of the following formats:

    ``TestNamespace\TestCaseClass::testMethod``

        The default test name format is the equivalent of using
        the ``__METHOD__`` magic constant inside
        the test method.

    ``TestNamespace\TestCaseClass::testMethod with data set #0``

        When a test has a data provider, each iteration of the
        data gets the current index appended to the end of the
        default test name.

    ``TestNamespace\TestCaseClass::testMethod with data set "my named data"``

        When a test has a data provider that uses named sets, each
        iteration of the data gets the current name appended to the
        end of the default test name. See
        :numref:`textui.examples.TestCaseClass.php` for an
        example of named data sets.

        .. code-block:: php
            :caption: Named data sets
            :name: textui.examples.TestCaseClass.php

            <?php
            namespace TestNamespace;

            use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

            class TestCaseClass extends TestCase
            {
                /**
                 * @dataProvider provider
                 */
                public function testMethod($data)
                {
                    $this->assertTrue($data);
                }

                public function provider()
                {
                    return [
                        'my named data' => [true],
                        'my data'       => [true]
                    ];
                }
            }

    ``/path/to/my/test.phpt``

        The test name for a PHPT test is the filesystem path.

    See :numref:`textui.examples.filter-patterns` for examples
    of valid filter patterns.

    .. code-block:: shell
        :caption: Filter pattern examples
        :name: textui.examples.filter-patterns

        --filter 'TestNamespace\\TestCaseClass::testMethod'
        --filter 'TestNamespace\\TestCaseClass'
        --filter TestNamespace
        --filter TestCaseClass
        --filter testMethod
        --filter '/::testMethod .*"my named data"/'
        --filter '/::testMethod .*#5$/'
        --filter '/::testMethod .*#(5|6|7)$/'

    See :numref:`textui.examples.filter-shortcuts` for some
    additional shortcuts that are available for matching data
    providers.

    .. code-block:: shell
        :caption: Filter shortcuts
        :name: textui.examples.filter-shortcuts

        --filter 'testMethod#2'
        --filter 'testMethod#2-4'
        --filter '#2'
        --filter '#2-4'
        --filter 'testMethod@my named data'
        --filter 'testMethod@my.*data'
        --filter '@my named data'
        --filter '@my.*data'

``--testsuite``

    Only runs the test suite whose name matches the given pattern.

``--group``

    Only runs tests from the specified group(s). A test can be tagged as
    belonging to a group using the ``@group`` annotation.

    The ``@author`` and ``@ticket`` annotations are aliases for
    ``@group`` allowing to filter tests based on their
    authors or their ticket identifiers, respectively.

``--exclude-group``

    Exclude tests from the specified group(s). A test can be tagged as
    belonging to a group using the ``@group`` annotation.

``--list-groups``

    List available test groups.

``--test-suffix``

    Only search for test files with specified suffix(es).

``--dont-report-useless-tests``

    Do not report tests that do not test anything. See :ref:`risky-tests` for details.

``--strict-coverage``

    Be strict about unintentionally covered code. See :ref:`risky-tests` for details.

``--strict-global-state``

    Be strict about global state manipulation. See :ref:`risky-tests` for details.

``--disallow-test-output``

    Be strict about output during tests. See :ref:`risky-tests` for details.

``--enforce-time-limit``

    Enforce time limit based on test size. See :ref:`risky-tests` for details.

``--process-isolation``

    Run each test in a separate PHP process.

``--no-globals-backup``

    Do not backup and restore $GLOBALS. See :ref:`fixtures.global-state`
    for more details.

``--static-backup``

    Backup and restore static attributes of user-defined classes.
    See :ref:`fixtures.global-state` for more details.

``--colors``

    Use colors in output.
    On Windows, use `ANSICON <https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon>`_ or `ConEmu <https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu>`_.

    There are three possible values for this option:

    -

      ``never``: never displays colors in the output. This is the default value when ``--colors`` option is not used.

    -

      ``auto``: displays colors in the output unless the current terminal doesn't supports colors,
      or if the output is piped to a command or redirected to a file.

    -

      ``always``: always displays colors in the output even when the current terminal doesn't supports colors,
      or when the output is piped to a command or redirected to a file.

    When ``--colors`` is used without any value, ``auto`` is the chosen value.

``--columns``

    Defines the number of columns to use for progress output.
    If ``max`` is defined as value, the number of columns will be maximum of the current terminal.

``--stderr``

    Optionally print to ``STDERR`` instead of
    ``STDOUT``.

``--stop-on-error``

    Stop execution upon first error.

``--stop-on-failure``

    Stop execution upon first error or failure.

``--stop-on-risky``

    Stop execution upon first risky test.

``--stop-on-skipped``

    Stop execution upon first skipped test.

``--stop-on-incomplete``

    Stop execution upon first incomplete test.

``--verbose``

    Output more verbose information, for instance the names of tests
    that were incomplete or have been skipped.

``--testdox``

    Reports the test progress in TestDox format (see :ref:`textui.testdox`).

``--bootstrap``

    A "bootstrap" PHP file that is run before the tests.

``--configuration``, ``-c``

    Read configuration from XML file.
    See :ref:`appendixes.configuration` for more details.

    If :file:`phpunit.xml` or
    :file:`phpunit.xml.dist` (in that order) exist in the
    current working directory and ``--configuration`` is
    *not* used, the configuration will be automatically
    read from that file.

    If a directory is specified and if
    :file:`phpunit.xml` or :file:`phpunit.xml.dist` (in that order)
    exists in this directory, the configuration will be
    automatically read from that file.

``--no-configuration``

    Ignore :file:`phpunit.xml` and
    :file:`phpunit.xml.dist` from the current working
    directory.

``--include-path``

    Prepend PHP's ``include_path`` with given path(s).

``-d``

    Sets the value of the given PHP configuration option.

.. admonition:: Note

   Please note that options can be put after the argument(s).

.. _textui.testdox:

TestDox
=======

PHPUnit's TestDox functionality looks at a test class and all the test
method names and converts them from camel case (or snake_case) PHP names to sentences:
``testBalanceIsInitiallyZero()`` (or ``test_balance_is_initially_zero()`` becomes "Balance is
initially zero". If there are several test methods whose names only
differ in a suffix of one or more digits, such as
``testBalanceCannotBecomeNegative()`` and
``testBalanceCannotBecomeNegative2()``, the sentence
"Balance cannot become negative" will appear only once, assuming that
all of these tests succeed.

Let us take a look at the documentation generated for a
``BankAccount`` class:

.. parsed-literal::

    $ phpunit --testdox BankAccountTest.php
    PHPUnit |version|.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

    BankAccount
     ✔ Balance is initially zero
     ✔ Balance cannot become negative

Alternatively, the documentation can be generated in HTML or plain
text format and written to a file using the ``--testdox-html``
and ``--testdox-text`` arguments.
