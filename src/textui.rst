============================
The Command-Line Test Runner
============================

The PHPUnit command-line test runner can be invoked through the
:file:`phpunit` command. The following code shows how to run
tests with the PHPUnit command-line test runner:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ phpunit ArrayTest
    PHPUnit |version|.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

    ..

    Time: 0 seconds

    OK (2 tests, 2 assertions)

When invoked as shown above, the PHPUnit command-line test runner will look
for a :file:`ArrayTest.php` sourcefile in the current working
directory, load it, and expect to find a ``ArrayTest`` test
case class. It will then execute the tests of that class.

For each test run, the PHPUnit command-line tool prints one character to
indicate progress:

``.``

    Printed when the test succeeds.

``F``

    Printed when an assertion fails while running the test method.

``E``

    Printed when an error occurs while running the test method.

``R``

    Printed when the test has been marked as risky (see
    :ref:`risky-tests`).

``S``

    Printed when the test has been skipped (see
    :ref:`incomplete-and-skipped-tests`).

``I``

    Printed when the test is marked as being incomplete or not yet
    implemented (see :ref:`incomplete-and-skipped-tests`).

PHPUnit distinguishes between *failures* and
*errors*. A failure is a violated PHPUnit
assertion such as a failing ``assertSame()`` call.
An error is an unexpected exception or a PHP error. Sometimes
this distinction proves useful since errors tend to be easier to fix
than failures. If you have a big list of problems, it is best to
tackle the errors first and see if you have any failures left when
they are all fixed.

``phpunit UnitTest``

    Runs the tests that are provided by the class
    ``UnitTest``. This class is expected to be declared
    in the :file:`UnitTest.php` sourcefile.

    ``UnitTest`` must be either a class that inherits
    from ``PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase`` or a class that
    provides a ``public static suite()`` method which
    returns a ``PHPUnit\Framework\Test`` object, for
    example an instance of the
    ``PHPUnit\Framework\TestSuite`` class.

``phpunit UnitTest UnitTest.php``

    Runs the tests that are provided by the class
    ``UnitTest``. This class is expected to be declared
    in the specified sourcefile.

``--coverage-clover``

    Generates a logfile in XML format with the code coverage information
    for the tests run. See :ref:`logging` for more details.

    Please note that this functionality is only available when the
    tokenizer and Xdebug extensions are installed.

``--coverage-crap4j``

    Generates a code coverage report in Crap4j format. See
    :ref:`code-coverage-analysis` for more details.

    Please note that this functionality is only available when the
    tokenizer and Xdebug extensions are installed.

``--coverage-html``

    Generates a code coverage report in HTML format. See
    :ref:`code-coverage-analysis` for more details.

    Please note that this functionality is only available when the
    tokenizer and Xdebug extensions are installed.

``--coverage-php``

    Generates a serialized PHP_CodeCoverage object with the
    code coverage information.

    Please note that this functionality is only available when the
    tokenizer and Xdebug extensions are installed.

``--coverage-text``

    Generates a logfile or command-line output in human readable format
    with the code coverage information for the tests run.
    See :ref:`logging` for more details.

    Please note that this functionality is only available when the
    tokenizer and Xdebug extensions are installed.

``--log-junit``

    Generates a logfile in JUnit XML format for the tests run.
    See :ref:`logging` for more details.

``--testdox-html`` and ``--testdox-text``

    Generates agile documentation in HTML or plain text format for the
    tests that are run (see :ref:`textui.testdox`).

``--filter``

    Only runs tests whose name matches the given regular expression
    pattern. If the pattern is not enclosed in delimiters, PHPUnit
    will enclose the pattern in ``/`` delimiters.

    The test names to match will be in one of the following formats:

    ``TestNamespace\TestCaseClass::testMethod``

        The default test name format is the equivalent of using
        the ``__METHOD__`` magic constant inside
        the test method.

    ``TestNamespace\TestCaseClass::testMethod with data set #0``

        When a test has a data provider, each iteration of the
        data gets the current index appended to the end of the
        default test name.

    ``TestNamespace\TestCaseClass::testMethod with data set "my named data"``

        When a test has a data provider that uses named sets, each
        iteration of the data gets the current name appended to the
        end of the default test name. See
        :numref:`textui.examples.TestCaseClass.php` for an
        example of named data sets.

        .. code-block:: php
            :caption: Named data sets
            :name: textui.examples.TestCaseClass.php

            <?php
            use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

            namespace TestNamespace;

            class TestCaseClass extends TestCase
            {
                /**
                 * @dataProvider provider
                 */
                public function testMethod($data)
                {
                    $this->assertTrue($data);
                }

                public function provider()
                {
                    return [
                        'my named data' => [true],
                        'my data'       => [true]
                    ];
                }
            }

    ``/path/to/my/test.phpt``

        The test name for a PHPT test is the filesystem path.

    See :numref:`textui.examples.filter-patterns` for examples
    of valid filter patterns.

    .. code-block:: shell
        :caption: Filter pattern examples
        :name: textui.examples.filter-patterns

        --filter 'TestNamespace\\TestCaseClass::testMethod'
        --filter 'TestNamespace\\TestCaseClass'
        --filter TestNamespace
        --filter TestCaseClase
        --filter testMethod
        --filter '/::testMethod .*"my named data"/'
        --filter '/::testMethod .*#5$/'
        --filter '/::testMethod .*#(5|6|7)$/'

    See :numref:`textui.examples.filter-shortcuts` for some
    additional shortcuts that are available for matching data
    providers.

    .. code-block:: shell
        :caption: Filter shortcuts
        :name: textui.examples.filter-shortcuts

        --filter 'testMethod#2'
        --filter 'testMethod#2-4'
        --filter '#2'
        --filter '#2-4'
        --filter 'testMethod@my named data'
        --filter 'testMethod@my.*data'
        --filter '@my named data'
        --filter '@my.*data'

``--testsuite``

    Only runs the test suite whose name matches the given pattern.

``--group``

    Only runs tests from the specified group(s). A test can be tagged as
    belonging to a group using the ``@group`` annotation.

    The ``@author`` and ``@ticket`` annotations are aliases for
    ``@group`` allowing to filter tests based on their
    authors or their ticket identifiers, respectively.

``--exclude-group``

    Exclude tests from the specified group(s). A test can be tagged as
    belonging to a group using the ``@group`` annotation.

``--list-groups``

    List available test groups.

``--test-suffix``

    Only search for test files with specified suffix(es).

``--dont-report-useless-tests``

    Do not report tests that do not test anything. See :ref:`risky-tests` for details.

``--strict-coverage``

    Be strict about unintentionally covered code. See :ref:`risky-tests` for details.

``--strict-global-state``

    Be strict about global state manipulation. See :ref:`risky-tests` for details.

``--disallow-test-output``

    Be strict about output during tests. See :ref:`risky-tests` for details.

``--disallow-todo-tests``

    Does not execute tests which have the ``@todo`` annotation in its docblock.

``--enforce-time-limit``

    Enforce time limit based on test size. See :ref:`risky-tests` for details.

``--process-isolation``

    Run each test in a separate PHP process.

``--no-globals-backup``

    Do not backup and restore $GLOBALS. See :ref:`fixtures.global-state`
    for more details.

``--static-backup``

    Backup and restore static attributes of user-defined classes.
    See :ref:`fixtures.global-state` for more details.

``--colors``

    Use colors in output.
    On Windows, use `ANSICON <https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon>`_ or `ConEmu <https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu>`_.

    There are three possible values for this option:

    -

      ``never``: never displays colors in the output. This is the default value when ``--colors`` option is not used.

    -

      ``auto``: displays colors in the output unless the current terminal doesn't supports colors,
      or if the output is piped to a command or redirected to a file.

    -

      ``always``: always displays colors in the output even when the current terminal doesn't supports colors,
      or when the output is piped to a command or redirected to a file.

    When ``--colors`` is used without any value, ``auto`` is the chosen value.

``--columns``

    Defines the number of columns to use for progress output.
    If ``max`` is defined as value, the number of columns will be maximum of the current terminal.

``--stderr``

    Optionally print to ``STDERR`` instead of
    ``STDOUT``.

``--stop-on-error``

    Stop execution upon first error.

``--stop-on-failure``

    Stop execution upon first error or failure.

``--stop-on-risky``

    Stop execution upon first risky test.

``--stop-on-skipped``

    Stop execution upon first skipped test.

``--stop-on-incomplete``

    Stop execution upon first incomplete test.

``--verbose``

    Output more verbose information, for instance the names of tests
    that were incomplete or have been skipped.

``--debug``

    Output debug information such as the name of a test when its
    execution starts.

``--loader``

    Specifies the ``PHPUnit\Runner\TestSuiteLoader``
    implementation to use.

    The standard test suite loader will look for the sourcefile in the
    current working directory and in each directory that is specified in
    PHP's ``include_path`` configuration directive.
    A class name such as ``Project_Package_Class`` is
    mapped to the source filename
    :file:`Project/Package/Class.php`.

``--repeat``

    Repeatedly runs the test(s) the specified number of times.

``--testdox``

    Reports the test progress in TestDox format (see :ref:`textui.testdox`).

``--printer``

    Specifies the result printer to use. The printer class must extend
    ``PHPUnit\Util\Printer`` and implement the
    ``PHPUnit\Framework\TestListener`` interface.

``--bootstrap``

    A "bootstrap" PHP file that is run before the tests.

``--configuration``, ``-c``

    Read configuration from XML file.
    See :ref:`appendixes.configuration` for more details.

    If :file:`phpunit.xml` or
    :file:`phpunit.xml.dist` (in that order) exist in the
    current working directory and ``--configuration`` is
    *not* used, the configuration will be automatically
    read from that file.

    If a directory is specified and if
    :file:`phpunit.xml` or :file:`phpunit.xml.dist` (in that order)
    exists in this directory, the configuration will be
    automatically read from that file.

``--no-configuration``

    Ignore :file:`phpunit.xml` and
    :file:`phpunit.xml.dist` from the current working
    directory.

``--include-path``

    Prepend PHP's ``include_path`` with given path(s).

``-d``

    Sets the value of the given PHP configuration option.

.. admonition:: Note

   Please note that as of 4.8, options can be put after the argument(s).

.. _textui.testdox:

TestDox
#######

PHPUnit's TestDox functionality looks at a test class and all the test
method names and converts them from camel case (or snake_case) PHP names to sentences:
``testBalanceIsInitiallyZero()`` (or ``test_balance_is_initially_zero()`` becomes "Balance is
initially zero". If there are several test methods whose names only
differ in a suffix of one or more digits, such as
``testBalanceCannotBecomeNegative()`` and
``testBalanceCannotBecomeNegative2()``, the sentence
"Balance cannot become negative" will appear only once, assuming that
all of these tests succeed.

Let us take a look at the agile documentation generated for a
``BankAccount`` class:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ phpunit --testdox BankAccountTest
    PHPUnit |version|.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

    BankAccount
     ✔ Balance is initially zero
     ✔ Balance cannot become negative

Alternatively, the agile documentation can be generated in HTML or plain
text format and written to a file using the ``--testdox-html``
and ``--testdox-text`` arguments.

Agile Documentation can be used to document the assumptions you make
about the external packages that you use in your project. When you use
an external package, you are exposed to the risks that the package will
not behave as you expect, and that future versions of the package will
change in subtle ways that will break your code, without you knowing it.
You can address these risks by writing a test every time you make an
assumption. If your test succeeds, your assumption is valid. If you
document all your assumptions with tests, future releases of the
external package will be no cause for concern: if the tests succeed,
your system should continue working.
