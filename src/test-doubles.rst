************
Test Doubles
************

Gerard Meszaros introduces the concept of Test Doubles in
his "xUnit Test Patterns" book like so:

    Sometimes it is just plain hard to test the system under test (SUT)
    because it depends on other components that cannot be used in the test
    environment. This could be because they aren't available, they will not
    return the results needed for the test or because executing them would
    have undesirable side effects. In other cases, our test strategy requires
    us to have more control or visibility of the internal behavior of the SUT.

    When we are writing a test in which we cannot (or chose not to) use a real
    depended-on component (DOC), we can replace it with a Test Double. The
    Test Double doesn't have to behave exactly like the real DOC; it merely
    has to provide the same API as the real one so that the SUT thinks it is
    the real one!

The ``createStub(string $type)`` and ``createMock(string $type)`` methods can be used
in a test to automatically generate an object that can act as a test double for the
specified original type (interface or extendable class). This test double object can be used
in every context where an object of the original type is expected or required.

.. admonition:: Limitation: final, private, and static methods

   Please note that ``final``, ``private``, and ``static`` methods cannot
   be doubled. They are ignored by PHPUnit's test double functionality and
   retain their original behavior except for ``static`` methods which will
   be replaced by a method throwing an exception. In case of final classes 
   you can define an interface that a class implements and then mock that interface. 
   This approach is more flexible and allows for better separation of the interface from the implementation.
  

.. admonition:: Limitation: Enumerations and readonly classes

   Enumerations (``enum``) are ``final`` classes and therefore cannot be
   doubled. ``readonly`` classes cannot be extended by classes that are
   not ``readonly`` and therefore cannot be doubled.

.. admonition:: Favour doubling interfaces over doubling classes

   Not only because of the limitations mentioned above, but also to improve
   your software design, favour the doubling of interfaces over the doubling
   of classes.


.. _test-doubles.test-stubs:

Test Stubs
==========

The practice of replacing an object with a test double that (optionally) returns
configured return values is referred to as *stubbing*. You can use a *test stub* to
"replace a real component on which the SUT depends so that the test has a control
point for the indirect inputs of the SUT. This allows the test to force the SUT
down paths it might not otherwise execute" (Gerard Meszaros).


Creating Test Stubs
-------------------

``createStub()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``createStub(string $type)`` method returns a test stub for the specified interface or extendable class.

All methods of the original type are replaced with an implementation that returns an automatically
generated value that satisfies the method's return type declaration without calling the original method.
These methods are referred to as "doubled methods".

The behaviour of doubled methods can be configured using methods such as ``willReturn()`` or
``willThrowException()``. These methods are explained later.


``createStubForIntersectionOfInterfaces()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``createStubForIntersectionOfInterfaces(array $interfaces)`` method can be used to
create a test stub for an intersection of interfaces based on a list of interface names.

Consider you have the following interfaces ``X`` and ``Y``:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/X.php
   :caption: An interface named X
   :language: php

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/Y.php
   :caption: An interface named Y
   :language: php

And you have a class that you want to test named ``Z``:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/Z.php
   :caption: A class named Z
   :language: php

To test ``Z``, we need an object that satisfies the intersection type ``X&Y``. We can
use the ``createStubForIntersectionOfInterfaces(array $interfaces)`` method to create
a test stub that satisfies ``X&Y`` like so:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/StubForIntersectionExampleTest.php
   :caption: Using createStubForIntersectionOfInterfaces() to create a test stub for an intersection type
   :language: php


``createConfiguredStub()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``createConfiguredStub()`` method is a convenience wrapper around ``createStub()`` that allows configuring
return values using an associative array (``['methodName' => <return value>]``):

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/CreateConfiguredStubExampleTest.php
   :caption: Using createConfiguredStub() to create a test stub and configure return values
   :language: php


Configuring Test Stubs
----------------------

``willReturn()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the ``willReturn()`` method, for instance, you can configure a doubled method to return a
specified value when it is called. This configured value must be compatible with the method's
return type declaration.

Consider that we have a class that we want to test, ``SomeClass``, which depends
on ``Dependency``:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/SomeClass.php
   :caption: The class we want to test
   :language: php

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/Dependency.php
   :caption: The dependency we want to stub
   :language: php

Here is a first example of how to use the ``createStub(string $type)`` method to
create a test stub for ``Dependency`` so that we can test ``SomeClass`` without
using a real implementation of ``Dependency``:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/SomeClassTest.php
   :caption: Stubbing a method call to return a fixed value
   :name: test-doubles.test-stubs.examples.SomeClassTest.php
   :language: php

.. admonition:: Limitation: Methods named "method"

   The example shown above only works when the original interface or class does not
   declare a method named "method".

   If the original interface or class does declare a method named "method" then
   ``$stub->expects($this->any())->method('doSomething')->willReturn('foo');``
   has to be used.

.. admonition:: Deprecation: Doubling interfaces (or classes) that have a method named "method"

   As of PHPUnit 10.3, the support for doubling interfaces (or classes) that have
   a method named "method" is soft-deprecated, meaning the deprecation is in documentation
   only.

   Starting with PHPUnit 11, doubling interfaces (or classes) that have a method named "method"
   will trigger a deprecation warning. Support for doubling interfaces (or classes) that have a
   method named "method" will be removed in PHPUnit 12.

In the example shown above, we first use the ``createStub()`` method to create a test stub,
an object that looks like an instance of ``Dependency``.

We then use the `Fluent Interface <http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html>`_
that PHPUnit provides to specify the behavior for the test stub.

"Behind the scenes", PHPUnit automatically generates a new PHP class that implements
the desired behavior when the ``createStub()`` method is used.

Please note that ``createStub()`` will automatically and recursively stub return values
based on a method's return type. Consider the example shown below:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/C.php
   :caption: A method with a return type declaration
   :language: php

In the example shown above, the ``C::m()`` method has a return type declaration
indicating that this method returns an object of type ``D``. When a test double
for ``C`` is created and no return value is configured for ``m()`` using
``willReturn()`` (see above), for instance, then when ``m()`` is invoked PHPUnit
will automatically create a test double for ``D`` to be returned.

Similarly, if ``m`` had a return type declaration for a scalar type then a return
value such as ``0`` (for ``int``), ``0.0`` (for ``float``), or ``[]`` (for ``array``)
would be generated.

A list of desired return values can also be specified. Here is an example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/OnConsecutiveCallsExampleTest.php
   :caption: Using willReturn() to stub a method call to return a list of values in the specified order
   :language: php


``willThrowException()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of returning a value, a stubbed method can also raise an exception.
Here is an example that shows how to use ``willThrowException()`` to do this:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/ThrowExceptionExampleTest.php
   :caption: Using willThrowException() to stub a method call to throw an exception
   :language: php


``willReturnArgument()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes you want to return one of the arguments of a method call (unchanged) as the
result of a stubbed method call. Here is an example that shows how you can achieve this
using ``willReturnArgument()``:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/ReturnArgumentExampleTest.php
   :caption: Using willReturnArgument() to stub a method call to return one of the arguments
   :language: php


``willReturnCallback()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the stubbed method call should return a calculated value instead of a fixed one
(see ``willReturn()``) or an (unchanged) argument (see ``willReturnArgument()``), you
can use ``willReturnCallback()`` to have the stubbed method return the result of a callback
function or method. Here is an example:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/ReturnCallbackExampleTest.php
   :caption: Using willReturnCallback() to stub a method call to return a value from a callback
   :language: php


``willReturnSelf()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When testing a fluent interface, it is sometimes useful to have a stubbed method return
a reference to the stubbed object. Here is an example that shows how you can use
``willReturnSelf()`` to achieve this:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/ReturnSelfExampleTest.php
   :caption: Using willReturnSelf() to stub a method call to return a reference to the stub object
   :language: php


``willReturnMap()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes a stubbed method should return different values depending on a predefined list
of arguments. Here is an example that shows how to use ``willReturnMap()`` to create a map
that associates arguments with corresponding return values:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/ReturnMapExampleTest.php
   :caption: Using willReturnMap() to stub a method call to return the value from a map
   :language: php


.. _test-doubles.mock-objects:

Mock Objects
============

The practice of replacing an object with a test double that verifies
expectations, for instance asserting that a method has been called, is
referred to as *mocking*.

You can use a *mock object* "as an observation point that is used to verify
the indirect outputs of the SUT as it is exercised. Typically, the mock object
also includes the functionality of a test stub in that it must return values to
the SUT if it hasn't already failed the tests but the emphasis is on the
verification of the indirect outputs. Therefore, a mock object is a lot more than
just a test stub plus assertions; it is used in a fundamentally different way"
(Gerard Meszaros).


Creating Mock Objects
---------------------

``createMock()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``createMock(string $type)`` method returns a mock object for the specified interface or extendable class.

All methods of the original type are replaced with an implementation that returns an automatically
generated value that satisfies the method's return type declaration without calling the original method.
These methods are referred to as "doubled methods".

The behaviour of doubled methods can be configured using methods such as ``willReturn()`` or
``willThrowException()``. These methods are explained in the section on Test Stubs above.

Expectations for invocations of doubled methods ("method must be called with specified arguments",
"method must not be called", etc.) can be configured using the mock object's ``expects()`` method.


``createMockForIntersectionOfInterfaces()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``createMockForIntersectionOfInterfaces(array $interfaces)`` method can be used to
create a mock object for an intersection of interfaces based on a list of interface names.

Consider you have the following interfaces ``X`` and ``Y``:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/X.php
   :caption: An interface named X
   :language: php

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/Y.php
   :caption: An interface named Y
   :language: php

And you have a class that you want to test named ``Z``:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/Z.php
   :caption: A class named Z
   :language: php

To test ``Z``, we need an object that satisfies the intersection type ``X&Y``. We can
use the ``createMockForIntersectionOfInterfaces(array $interfaces)`` method to create
a test stub that satisfies ``X&Y`` like so:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/MockForIntersectionExampleTest.php
   :caption: Using createMockForIntersectionOfInterfaces() to create a mock object for an intersection type
   :language: php


``createConfiguredMock()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``createConfiguredMock()`` method is a convenience wrapper around ``createMock()`` that allows configuring
return values using an associative array (``['methodName' => <return value>]``):

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/CreateConfiguredMockExampleTest.php
   :caption: Using createConfiguredMock() to create a mock object and configure return values
   :language: php


``getMockForAbstractClass()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``getMockForAbstractClass()`` method returns a mock
object for an abstract class. All abstract methods of the given abstract
class are mocked. This allows for testing the concrete methods of an
abstract class.

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/AbstractClass.php
   :caption: An abstract class with a concrete method
   :language: php

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/AbstractClassTest.php
   :caption: A test for a concrete method of an abstract class
   :language: php

.. admonition:: Deprecation: ``getMockForAbstractClass()`` is deprecated

   As of PHPUnit 10.1, the ``getMockForAbstractClass()`` method is soft-deprecated,
   meaning its declaration is annotated with ``@deprecated`` so that IDEs and
   static analysis tools can warn about its usage.

   Starting with PHPUnit 11, using the ``getMockForAbstractClass()`` method
   will trigger a deprecation warning. The method will be removed in PHPUnit 12.


``getMockForTrait()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``getMockForTrait()`` method returns a mock object
that uses a specified trait. All abstract methods of the given trait
are mocked. This allows for testing the concrete methods of a trait.

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/AbstractTrait.php
   :caption: A trait with an abstract method
   :language: php

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/AbstractTraitTest.php
   :caption: A test for a concrete method of a trait
   :language: php

.. admonition:: Deprecation: ``getMockForTrait()`` is deprecated

   As of PHPUnit 10.1, the ``getMockForTrait()`` method is soft-deprecated,
   meaning its declaration is annotated with ``@deprecated`` so that IDEs and
   static analysis tools can warn about its usage.

   Starting with PHPUnit 11, using the ``getMockForTrait()`` method
   will trigger a deprecation warning. The method will be removed in PHPUnit 12.


``getMockFromWsdl()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When your application interacts with a web service you want to test it
without actually interacting with the web service. To create stubs
and mocks of web services, the ``getMockFromWsdl()`` method can be used.

This method returns a mock object based on a web service description in WSDL whereas
``createMock()`` returns a mock object based on an interface or on a class.

Here is an example that shows how to stub the web service described in :file:`HelloService.wsdl`:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/WsdlStubExampleTest.php
   :caption: Stubbing a web service
   :language: php

.. admonition:: Deprecation: ``getMockFromWsdl()`` is deprecated

   As of PHPUnit 10.1, the ``getMockFromWsdl()`` method is soft-deprecated,
   meaning its declaration is annotated with ``@deprecated`` so that IDEs and
   static analysis tools can warn about its usage.

   Starting with PHPUnit 11, using the ``getMockFromWsdl()`` method
   will trigger a deprecation warning. The method will be removed in PHPUnit 12.


Configuring Mock Objects
------------------------

Here is an example: suppose we want to test that the correct method, ``update()``
in our example, is called on an object that observes another object.

Here is the code for the ``Subject`` class and the ``Observer`` interface that are part
of the System under Test (SUT):

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/Subject.php
   :caption: Subject class that is part of the System under Test (SUT)
   :language: php

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/src/Observer.php
   :caption: Observer interface that is part of the System under Test (SUT)
   :language: php

Here is an example that shows how to use a mock object to test the interaction between
``Subject`` and ``Observer`` objects:

.. literalinclude:: examples/test-doubles/SubjectTest.php
   :caption: Testing that a method gets called once and with a specified argument
   :language: php

We first use the ``createMock()`` method to create a mock object for the ``Observer``.

Because we are interested in verifying the communication between two objects (that a method is called
and which arguments it is called with), we use the ``expects()`` and ``with()`` methods to specify
what this communication should look like.

The ``with()`` method can take any number of arguments, corresponding to the number of arguments
to the method being mocked. You can specify more advanced constraints on the method's arguments
than a simple match.

:ref:`appendixes.assertions.assertThat.tables.constraints` shows the constraints that can be
applied to method arguments and here is a list of the matchers that are available to specify
the number of invocations:

-

  ``any()`` returns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is executed zero or more times

-

  ``never()`` returns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is never executed

-

  ``atLeastOnce()`` returns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is executed at least once

-

  ``once()`` returns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is executed exactly once

-

  ``atMost(int $count)`` returns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is executed at most ``$count`` times

-

  ``exactly(int $count)`` returns a matcher that matches when the method it is evaluated for is executed exactly ``$count`` times


MockBuilder API
===============

As mentioned before, when the defaults used by the ``createStub()`` and ``createMock()`` methods
to generate the test double do not match your needs then you can use the ``getMockBuilder($type)``
method to customize the test double generation using a fluent interface. The methods provided by
the Mock Builder are documented below.


``setMockClassName()``
----------------------

``setMockClassName($name)`` can be used to specify a class name for the generated test double class.

.. admonition:: Deprecation: ``setMockClassName()`` is deprecated

   As of PHPUnit 10.3, the ``setMockClassName()`` method is soft-deprecated,
   meaning its declaration is annotated with ``@deprecated`` so that IDEs and
   static analysis tools can warn about its usage.

   Starting with PHPUnit 11, using the ``setMockClassName()`` method will trigger a deprecation warning.
   The method will be removed in PHPUnit 12.


``setConstructorArgs()``

``setConstructorArgs(array $args)`` can be called to provide a parameter array that is passed to the original class' constructor (which is not replaced with a dummy implementation by default).


``disableOriginalConstructor()``
--------------------------------

``disableOriginalConstructor()`` can be used to disable the call to the constructor of the original class.

``enableOriginalConstructor()`` can be used to make it explicit that the constructor of the original class should be called (which is the default behaviour).

   meaning their declaration is annotated with ``@deprecated`` so that IDEs and
   static analysis tools can warn about their usage.

   Starting with PHPUnit 11, using the ``enableArgumentCloning()`` and ``disableArgumentCloning()`` methods
   will trigger a deprecation warning. The methods will be removed in PHPUnit 12.


``disableAutoReturnValueGeneration()``
--------------------------------------

``disableAutoReturnValueGeneration()`` can be used to disable the automatic generation of return values when no return value is configured.

``enableAutoReturnValueGeneration()`` can be used to make it explicit that automatic generation of return values when no return value is configured is enabled (which is the default).

   meaning their declaration is annotated with ``@deprecated`` so that IDEs and
   static analysis tools can warn about their usage.

   Starting with PHPUnit 11, using the ``disableAutoReturnValueGeneration()`` and ``enableAutoReturnValueGeneration()`` methods
   will trigger a deprecation warning. The methods will be removed in PHPUnit 12.


``disallowMockingUnknownTypes()``
---------------------------------

``disallowMockingUnknownTypes()`` can be used to disallow the doubling of unknown types.

``allowMockingUnknownTypes()`` can be used to make it explicit that the doubling of unknown types is allowed (which is the default).

.. admonition:: Deprecation: ``disallowMockingUnknownTypes()`` and ``allowMockingUnknownTypes()`` are deprecated

   As of PHPUnit 10.1, the ``disallowMockingUnknownTypes()`` and ``allowMockingUnknownTypes()`` methods are soft-deprecated,
   meaning their declaration is annotated with ``@deprecated`` so that IDEs and
   static analysis tools can warn about their usage.

   Starting with PHPUnit 11, using the ``disallowMockingUnknownTypes()`` and ``allowMockingUnknownTypes()`` methods
   will trigger a deprecation warning. The methods will be removed in PHPUnit 12.


``disableAutoload()``
---------------------

``disableAutoload()`` can be used to disable PHP's autoloading functionality during the generation of the test double class.

   static analysis tools can warn about their usage.

   Starting with PHPUnit 11, using the ``enableProxyingToOriginalMethods()``, ``setProxyTarget()``, and ``disableProxyingToOriginalMethods()`` methods
   will trigger a deprecation warning. The methods will be removed in PHPUnit 12.


``onlyMethods()``
-----------------

``onlyMethods(array $methods)`` can be called on the Mock Builder object to specify the methods that are to be replaced with a configurable test double. The behavior of the other methods is not changed. The specified methods must exist in the class that is mocked.


``addMethods()``
----------------

``addMethods(array $methods)`` can be called on the Mock Builder object to specify the methods that do not exist in the interface or class that is mocked. Methods that do exist in the interface or class remain unchanged.

.. admonition:: Deprecation: ``addMethods()`` is deprecated

   As of PHPUnit 10.1, the ``addMethods()`` method is soft-deprecated,
   meaning its declaration is annotated with ``@deprecated`` so that IDEs and

Here is an example that shows how to use the Mock Builder's fluent interface to configure
the creation of a test stub. The configuration of this test double uses the same best
practice defaults used by ``createStub()`` and ``createMock()``:
